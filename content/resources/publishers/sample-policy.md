Sample Name Change Policy for Publishers

<!--more-->

## Policy Template

### Introduction
JOURNAL/PUBLISHER NAME is committed to supporting requests for author name changes and pronoun changes. Names changes and pronoun changes are available upon request, and approved without documentation. All requests will be handled with confidentiality and as quickly as possible.

The sections below are the 5 Guiding Principles and Best Practices from “A Vision for a More Trans-Inclusive Publishing World” (https://publicationethics.org/news/vision-more-trans-inclusive-publishing-world). 

### Accessibility
Name changes should be available to authors upon request without legal documentation, unnecessary barriers, burdens, or labor placed upon the author making the request.
Authorial name changes to previously published articles may be requested by an author for any reason, including name changes due to marriage or divorce; nonwestern naming structures; or gender identity. Non-binary or trans authors who wish to request a change to a previous publication are particularly encouraged to contact the editors. Authors will not be asked to provide official or legal documentation of the name change, and all requests will be kept confidential by the editors. If applicable, any pronoun changes (as in a biographical entry) may be requested at the same time.

### Comprehensiveness
Name changes should remove all instances of an author's previous name from the records maintained and disseminated by the publisher.
Any request for a name change will result in removal of the earlier name from any and all publication repositories. This extends to both the metadata of the article as well as the PDF of the article itself. Although some publication flows may be out of the scope of JOURNAL/PUBLISHER NAME, the editors will make any effort to ensure that name changes are reflected in reprints and downstream publications. 

### Invisibility
Name changes should not draw attention to the gender identity of an author, nor create a clear juxtaposition between the current name and the previous name.
In order to maintain the author’s privacy, name changes will not be announced, nor will any notices be published that draw attention to the changes. Co-authors will not be notified of the change. 

### Expediency and Simplicity
Name changes should be implemented in a timely manner, and with a minimum of bureaucratic overhead.
Once received, requests will be processed in an expedient manner and will not require deliberation by the editorial/publication board. 

### Recurrence and Maintenance
Publishers should regularly audit and correct new instances of changed names in order to prevent ongoing dissemination of incorrect information.

JOURNAL/PUBLISHER NAME editors will cross-reference citations and bibliographies of newly submitted articles against an internal list of authors who have requested name changes in order to ensure that the earlier name is not included in any new articles published in JOURNAL/PUBLISHER NAME.

## Recommendations following policy introduction: 
- Promote Name Change Policy in the next couple of issues, in the editorial or introduction chapters
- Have a designated contact person/people to confer with authors and make name changes and pronoun changes.
- Communicate that all authors are eligible to request a name change
- Include on/under “Policies” section in/on journal/publishers website home or sub-page and in “Guide for authors and reviewers” page (if relevant)
