## Existing Policies

We have created [a public spreadsheet of publishers or journals with existing name change policies](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/k2032402_kcl_ac_uk/EVsKedB_EEhMireN1G8OB8IBnhb9q5v8nUigm5FG9N1Ffg). It includes links to the full policy as well as at-a-glance information on whether each policy is compatible with the [guiding principles](/principles/) described in our guest post for the Committee on Publication Ethics.
If you are aware of any policies missing from that spreadsheet, please let us know!
