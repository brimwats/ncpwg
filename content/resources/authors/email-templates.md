## Template for Authors to request name change

Hello <NAME>,
I’m an author of **a publication in *JOURNAL*/publications going back to the year 2000 in *JOURNAL***. Recently, I changed my first name and my pronouns, and I’m contacting all of the publishers of my published works to have them fixed, replacing my deadname with my correct name, fixing any pronouns, and correcting all papers citing publications using my deadname, which follows the COPE guidance on author name changes. Here's a link: https://publicationethics.org/news/vision-more-trans-inclusive-publishing-world 

I couldn’t find any guidance on the *JOURNAL* website about a process for correcting my name and pronouns in my publications and in publications that cite them. Does *JOURNAL* have such a process? If so, can you tell me who to contact about correcting my name and pronouns in my **NUMBER** of *JOURNAL* publications? If it does not have a process, who should I ask at *JOURNAL* to create one, in line with COPE’s guidance? I’d like to stop the researchers who cite my *JOURNAL* work monthly from spreading my deadname further, ideally as soon as possible.

For background on this request, I recommend the following articles:
- ACM, Publications Policy on Author Name Changes: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author-name-changes
- Science, New, More Inclusive Journal Policies Ease Author Name Changes on Published Papers: https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2021/02/new-more-inclusive-journal-policies-ease-author-name-changes-published-papers
- COPE, Update on COPE Guidance Regarding Author Name Changes: https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes

Thank you for your help!

## Template for reaching out to publication to request a policy

Dear *JOURNAL Editorial Board/Editor's Name, etc*

Recently, a number of scholars published an editorial in COPE (the Council on Publishing Ethics) calling for publishers to introduce, amend, or fix their name change policies for trans authors, who (are still) facing a lot of impacts from publisher policies that are more than a little harmful. Here's a link: https://publicationethics.org/news/vision-more-trans-inclusive-publishing-world 

These policies have also harmed married women who change their names, indigenous authors with name changes, or international authors with misspellings. It's exciting that the COPE editorial had a big impact on science journals—Science, Wiley, Taylor and Francis, some of Elsevier and others have introduced or begun implementing changes. Here's Wiley's page: https://authorservices.wiley.com/ethics-guidelines/index.html and I can provide you some more examples

Some universities have also taken action. For example, here is UF's: (https://librarypress.domains.uflib.ufl.edu/resources-for-authors/). 

As a **LIBRARIAN/STUDENT/STAFF/FACULTY MEMBER** at **INSERT UNI HERE** that subscribes to your journal **OR** that enjoys reading issues of your journal, I was hoping that you might have one too but I was not able to find any sort of policy on ***INSERT JOURNAL NAME HERE***'s website.

Do you have a name change policy that I could take a look at? If not, is the press interested in introducing a policy? If so I could put you in touch with a working group of librarians who are helping to implement these policies. 

All the best!
