This section includes resources for publishers who want to introduce a name change policy.

<!--more-->

## Existing Policies

- We have outlined [five high-level principles for trans-inclusive name changes in academic publishing](/principles/). The Committee on Publication Ethics has [formed a working group](https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes) that will publish more detailed guidance based on these high-level principles soon.

- We have created a [public spreadsheet of publishers or journals with existing name change policies](https://t.co/RW550fAaQ8) and whether they follow these high-level principles.

- EDIS Group has created [a guiding checklist](https://edisgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Inclusive-name-change-guidance-v4.pdf) to prompt publishers on all of the steps they need to consider when creating and implementing inclusive name change policies.

## Sample Policy

We are currently working on a sample policy. Please contact us if you are interested in this.
