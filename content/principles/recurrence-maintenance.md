## **Principle #5**
*Publishers should regularly audit and correct new instances of changed names in order to prevent ongoing dissemination of incorrect information.*

<!--more-->

Due to the citation driven nature of academic publishing, a single, swift, silent, comprehensive effort to correct a trans author's name is insufficient to prevent inadvertent disclosure and the associated risks and arms it carries. Once a name change has been implemented, publishers should be prepared for some degree of ongoing maintenance of their records to remove recurrences of the previous name.

This, more than any other principle we have laid out, has the potential to entail the publisher and/or the requesting author into an unsustainable amount of ongoing labor, at least with our current infrastructures and practices. We take this challenge, and those described above, as a starting place for rethinking how academic publishing can take the lead on implementing and adopting new systems identity infrastructures.
